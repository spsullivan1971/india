  "description": "Special Guest Review:  From the beginning, I knew I had something special. The light-up was all roasted wood and hickory. A tiny hint of sweetness to linger on your lips and palette. The second third gave me that stinging sensation that I love. Perfect with a nice coffee chaser. The final third, I hate to admit, was a bit too strong almost, particularly towards the last hit. The first two thirds made it worth it all however.",

  "description": "Editorial review: I was hoping to experience something like an Opus X kick with a complexity that could match a high quality Cuban cigar. First puffs brought a wonderful tobacco flavor that was in the background throughout the smoke. There were nice woody and peppery notes that didn't save the day. Overall, a mild, simple, medium-bodied cigar.",

  "description": "Editorial review: The Macanudo Vintage Maduro 1997 opened somewhat dry with a nuttiness layering the front of my palate. Once over the shoulder the first third of this smoke displayed nice spicy, woodsy, cedary characters to go along with the nuttiness. This very slow burning cigar gave part to a thin white smoke and extreme white ash. What was very interesting is the taste the wrapper leaf was leaving on my lips. A very sweet, sugary taste almost like a clove cigarette… interesting.",

  "description": "The flavour of this cigar is what really blew me away. Right off the bat I was getting nice creamy cappuccino smoke. There were hints of cedar on the palate reminiscent of the traditional Montecristo style however this cigar was much more committed to the creamy coffee flavours. The date for this box is from 2008 making it a 3 and a half year old box. I believe these cigars are at their prime smoking time right now. The youthful desire of the tobacco has been tempered by aged creating a rich harmony of flavours; a welcomed improvement from some of the younger Montecristos I smoked while in Cuba. The finish is smooth with noticeable leather. At this stage I would consider this cigar medium bodied. This is a change from the full-bodied pungent Cubans I normally turn to; however this cigar is nice in a subtler way.",

  "description": "The flavors deliver on the sweet promise of the pre-light aroma. They are nutty, slightly earthy, and have a hint of hay. There is something sugary here, but it is not overwhelming. During the middle third, the flavors move even deeper into earthy terrain, with the hay becoming more prominent—maybe the hay really is the main source of the sweetness. There is also a little spice, but it is very faint. In the final third, most of these flavors fall back, and I get a bakery flavor that reminds me of cake or maybe a cinnamon roll.",

  "description": "There are light aromas of tobacco and citrus at cold.This is starting very lightly but it is a treat. The smoke seems to be thin in the mouth but it is very tasty. The smoke is also pungent and sweet smelling. There are a lot of sweet flavors. I can taste honey, caramel and some coffee. The after taste is very clean and short. There aren’t any flavors left in mouth.The caramel flavors are really well defined. I am really enjoying this.The second part is very similar to the first one. It changes slightly and adds some toasted bread flavors. The sweet honey/caramel aroma is turning into a strong defined sweet cherry flavor. That’s pretty unexpected but quite good. There is more smoke and still no aftertaste lingering in the mouth. Past the halfway point, I can feel the nicotine build up. The body is light-medium.",

Although these muffins need no adornment, sometimes I can't resist smearing them with a little cream cheese icing.",

Sure enough, her first text when her flight landed was: Hungarian. Which is, of course, how we tell each other we’re hungry. After finding her in the holiday airport traffic behind an Alamo bus she settled into the back seat of our car and ate the muffin. She loved it, and I loved having her back in town. It was a great start to the holiday week.",
